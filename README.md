# Andrew's Notepad.

A place where I can write short notes on one small subject at a time. This blog represents the idea that we should all try to learn something new every day.

I have tried to curate moments where my understanding has "clicked", and my thought process behind it. It is often accompanied by handwritten notes and drawings.

As a result, the format of this blog is a series of "notes" which try to explain a single topic at a time, a single idea. They are not meant to be a comprehensive reference, or a guide to best practice. I write these notes for my future self, and in the hopes that they may also help someone else's understanding "click" as well.

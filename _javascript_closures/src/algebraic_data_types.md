# Algebraic Data Types

Algebraic data types (ADTs) are a fundamental system of data types that can be used in lambda calculus. The types are named after which operation they correspond to in algebra: sum types, product types, and exponent types. Users of non functional languages will be most familiar with product types (structs) and exponent types (functions).

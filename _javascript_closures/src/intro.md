## Javascript is too complicated...

Let's simplify it. There are lots of complicated things in modern javascript like if statements, objects, booleans, and classes. Wouldn't it be nice if we could get rid of all of this complicated stuff and just write clean code using only the basics?

This book will cover how to write almost any code using nothing but closures in pure JavaScript. Note that all of these principles apply to other languages as well.

## But why?

Primarily, out of morbid curiosity. But there are legitimate reasons to read this book:

- A language doesn't have the feature you want but has closures.
- An existing feature might be implemented more efficiently or with greater flexibility using the closure approach.
- You want to understand lambda calculus in a way that can actually be applied anywhere.

## Additional notes:

This book actually uses Typescript. This is to make some of the annotation easier to understand. Some of the parts of this book can get quite tehnical.

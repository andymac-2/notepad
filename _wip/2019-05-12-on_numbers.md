### What is a number exactly?

The more I understand about numbers the less I know what they are.

Numbers are, at their core used to keep track of things. We can use natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3.. etc) to count thinks like apples, grains of sand, pillows, sheep, or any object you can think of. It may not be particularly useful to worry about half a sheep, so we only care about natural numbers when counting things.

We then have real numbers which represent continuous quantities. They are useful for measuring distances, weighing objects, calculating probabilities, and other purposes.

We also have complex numbers which can represent things which start to become more abstract. We can represent waveforms, signals, or two dimensional coordinates. In traditional understanding, we see rational numbers as an extension of natural numbers, and complex numbers as an extension of rational numbers.

I argue that a number is a description of a *behaviour* of real things, and certain things exhibit the behaviour of numbers, but numbers are not a real thing ind and of themselves.

### Rings

A ring is like an adjective. It describes something in the same way we say that apples are red, we say that numbers are a ring. If red describes the colour of an apple a ring describes the behaviour of numbers.

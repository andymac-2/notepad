### What exactly do we mean by "true" and "false" in programming and logic.

We immediately gather some intuitive logic behind `true` and `false` when programming. Some expressions are true, and others are false, although a strict definition is not required to understand.

If we were in a math class and we intended to manipulate an equation, we could write something like so:

$$
3x + 10 = 25 \\
3x = 15 \\
x = 5
$$

Which we could also write as:

$$
3x + 10 = 25 \Rightarrow
3x = 15 \Rightarrow
x = 5
$$

The arrow means "implies", or "it follows that" or "if x then y". 

This is perfectly valid reasoning. At each step of the way we perform some valid algebraic manipulation, such as "subtract 10" or "divide by 3". As long as we perform the same manipulation to both sides of the equation, the next line is going to be valid. Essentially, if we use the rules of algebra correctly, and we start off with an equation which is true, we can only write statements which are true.

The statement above is problematic in itself. If the only way to generate a new true statement is to perform a manipulation on another statement which is true, then we would have no true statements. We at least need some statements that are "true" regardless of whether or not some other statement is true. We call these *axioms* and we *define* them to be true. They are true because that's what the definition of true is. Different logical systems may have different axioms, and we can draw different conclusions.

If any statement we can write that follows from any true statement is also true, then how can we prove something is false? To do that we introduce something that we defined to be false. Ee call it "bottom" and is written ⊥. This is opposed to "top" which is always true and written as ⊤. ⊥ is defined as false, and therefore cannot be derived from a true statement. Therefore, any statement which proves bottom is also false.
